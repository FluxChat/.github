# FluxChat

Welcome to FluxChat, a decentralized, peer-to-peer, encrypted chat application.

- See [FluxChat-py](fluxchat-py) if you want to use the Python client.
- See [FluxChat-ts](fluxchat-ts) if you want to use the TypeScript client.

Both clients use the same network protocol for communication.

See [Python wiki](fluxchat-py/wiki) and [TypeScript wiki](fluxchat-ts/wiki) for more details.

## Motivation

The motivation behind writing FluxChat is to gain knowledge in creating a network protocol, understanding distributed systems, and exploring various encryption methods and algorithms. FluxChat aims to serve as a communication tool for individuals who are concerned about privacy.

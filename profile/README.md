# FluxChat

Welcome to FluxChat, a decentralized, peer-to-peer, encrypted chat application.

We created two clients, which utilize the same network protocol for seamless communication.

If you prefer using the command-line interface, we recommend using the [FluxChat Python client](https://github.com/FluxChat/fluxchat-py). On the other hand, if you prefer a web-based interface for communication, the [FluxChat TypeScript client](https://github.com/FluxChat/fluxchat-ts) is the ideal choice.

See [Python wiki](https://github.com/FluxChat/fluxchat-py/wiki) and [TypeScript wiki](https://github.com/FluxChat/fluxchat-ts/wiki) for more details.

## Motivation

The motivation behind writing FluxChat is to gain knowledge in creating a network protocol, understanding distributed systems, and exploring various encryption methods and algorithms. FluxChat aims to serve as a communication tool for individuals who are concerned about privacy.
